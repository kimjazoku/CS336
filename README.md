### Stub

This is the program to put on your iLab.
Change the username

The psycopg2 package was not working with the default Python environment,
so I had to make a new one.

#### Creating environment
python3 -m venv ~/myenv
source ~/myenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install psycopg pandas tabulate

### Tunnel

Change the username, location of environment, and location of the stub program

### database_llm.py
Change the file path to where you have phi-3.5-mini installed
Change the REMOTE_SCRIPT_PATH to where you have the stub program stored
